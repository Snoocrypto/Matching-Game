# MatchingGame

This is a simple memory matching game where the user has to select 2 cards at a time to create matches.

I followed a tutorial made by Ania Kubow on freeCodeCamp

Additional major changes:
1. Styling
2. Added a browser icon
3. Added a "How To Play" button
4. Modified behaviour if match not successful
5. Modified card images and game theme
